                <h3>Ans: The full meaning of DOM is (Document Object Model). It's an interface that represents how HTML
                    documents are read by the browser. The purpose of DOM is it allows us to create, change, or remove
                    elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make the page more dynamic.

                <h2 class="mb-2 text-emerald-500">2. How to select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
                <h3>Ans: There are many ways to select HTML elements using DOM. The methods are given below:

                    <ul class="list-disc ml-20">
                        <li>getElementById()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByName()</li>
                        <li>querySelector()</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                        <li>getAttribute()</li>
                        <li>innerHTML</li>
                        <li>innerText</li>
                        <li>childNodes</li>
                        <li>firstChild</li>
                        <li>lastChild</li>
                        <li>parentNode</li>
                        <li>nextSibling</li>
                        <li>previousSibling</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="mb-2 text-emerald-500">3. What is event bubble?</h2>
                <h3>Ans: What we know about event bubble is that, when a element like button is clicked, an event is
                    directed to the element and if an event handler is set for the element the event handler will
                    trigger, after that the event then bubbles up to elements parent, on the other hand if the event
                    handler is set for the parent this event handler will trigger, after that the event will continue to
                    bubble until it gets to the top element.</h3>

                <h2 class="mb-2 text-emerald-500">4. What is a callback function and what's the use it?</h2>
                <h3>Ans: A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument, this
                    method allows a function to call another function.As we know Javascript runs code sequentially in
                    top to down order, but there are some cases that the code runs after something else happens and also
                    not sequentially, this we know is asynchronous programming, so callbacks make sure that the function
                    is not going to run before the task is finish but it will run after the task is finished. it helps
                    us to develop asynchronous Javascript code and keeps us safe from errors.</h3>
